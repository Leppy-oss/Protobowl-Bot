# Protobowl Bot
Protobowl bot is the **world's premiere bot** for systematically cracking away at [Protobowl](https://protobowl.com/)! <br>
It will automatically buzz, answer, skip, and memorize all questions before any human player possibly can.
Simply put, it's a flawless program that can't be beat! It can run 24/7, even when you're afk, and rack up tens of thousands of points overnight! <br>
Please note, however, that due to how goofy Protobowl is, the bot occasionally gets the question incorrect.
For some reason, Protobowl doesn't always accept flawless answers...

## About the Bot
Protobowl bot runs on [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/), a powerful cross-platform package for automating web browsers. More specifically, it uses Selenium's WebDriver. <br>
Protobowl bot is built on Python, and it serializes memorized answers to QIDs (Question IDs) using JSON. <br>
Protobowl bot was inspired by and aims to be an improvement upon Wyatt Carpenter's **[schopenhauer](https://github.com/wyattscarpenter/schopenhauer)** bot,
which unfortunately no longer works. I promise that Protobowl bot will be maintained more frequently! <br>
***All preexisting data, contained in `knowledge.json`, is FULL courtesy of data collected by the schopenhauer bot!*** <br>
***Please do note, however, that the bot will automatically collect data while playing, so any new questions will also be memorized!***

## How to Run Protobowl Bot
<ol>
<li> Download this Github repo by clicking on the green <code>Code</code> button in the top right corner and selecting "Download as ZIP." </li>
<li> Unzip/extract the archive and place it in your folder of choice. </li>
<li> Install Python 3.9+ from whatever source you wish. Personally, I like <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution" target="_blank">Anaconda</a>. </li>
<li> Use your package manager of choice (<a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_download/" target="_blank">pip</a> is easiest) to install Selenium with <b>version 4.3.0+</b>. </li>
<li> Install <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/" target="_blank">Mozilla Firefox</a>. </li>
<li> Inside your command prompt of choice, enter the `src` directory of the unzipped archive and type <code>python bot.py</code>. </li>
<li> Click "allow" if an administrator access prompt appears. I promise this program isn't malicious and you can always check the raw source code that it's running on. </li>
<li> The program should open up a new instance of Firefox and begin botting away! </li>
</ol>
